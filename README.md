# haptics

Used to be an experimental library for parsing tix files
but now this repo is being repurposed as an attempt to refactor HPC binary (i.e. `utils/hpc` of GHC repo) and to make it work as an independent tool.

Those files are copied from the commit snapshot [6fc920847f65e9b9f347bde42b2f9ec624468cfd](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/commit/6fc920847f65e9b9f347bde42b2f9ec624468cfd) of GHC.
